Exercise 1: The React Paradigm
Imperative vs Declarative: Imperative UI tells the system how to do each step, while Declarative UI
describes what the final result should be. Example: Imperative is giving step-by-step instructions to
make coffee, Declarative is simply ordering a coffee.
Component-based architecture benefits: Reusability (use once, reuse everywhere), Maintainability
(easy to update and debug), Scalability (applications grow in organized structure).
Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM. React compares changes using reconciliation
and updates only changed elements, which improves performance compared to direct DOM
manipulation.
